Pi IP Cam Tweeter
=================

A Node.js project for randomly taking a photo from one of a group of IP cameras and then posts it as a reply to a tweet that
the Node.js server is listening for.

This project uses the IP camera available from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/DBPOWER%C2%AE-Webcam-Internet-Infrated-Wireless/dp/B003VUY5PW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426014854&sr=8-1&keywords=ipcam), though it should be able to be adapted to work with most IP cameras.
